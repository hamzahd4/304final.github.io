            <h2>What is our target technology?</h2>
            <p>For our project, we have decided to take a focus on generative
                AI, specifically the technology  <a href="https://chatgpt.com" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>, developed by  <a href="https://openai.com" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>. It is built on the Generative Pretrained
                Transformer, or GPT architecture. This architecture allows it to understand language, context, and tone.
                It is a state-of-the-art large language model, capable of generating human-like text based on the user's
                input, allowing it to perform tasks such as having conversations, math, coding, and numerous other daily
                tasks. It represents a major advancement in natural language processing, allowing for more interactive,
                intelligent, and accessible communication between humans and machines.
